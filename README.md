We have had so much trouble with these meta tags. Over a period of several years now, the meta tags have not improved although the software has been updated numerous times.
I have tried talking to the publisher about it but still nothing has changed, the default meta tags shipped with the software are absolutely terrible and so we have been adding to them for a long time.
